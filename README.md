# Spring MVC Form Validation

I developed this simple project to test my understanding of **Spring MVC**.

I created a simple user registration form.

User details are validated against the conditions defined on the user fields in the backend.

The Server responds with appropriate error messages if the conditions are not met.


## Technogies used:


## Spring MVC, Spring Boot, JSP, Hibernate Validator
