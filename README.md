# Spring MVC Form Validation

I developed this simple project to test my understanding of **Spring MVC**.

I created a simple user registration form.

User details are validated against the conditions defined on the user fields in the backend.

The Server responds with appropriate error messages if the conditions are not met.


## Technogies used:


## Spring MVC, Spring Boot, JSP, Hibernate Validator, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap


User enters the valid credentials

User is taken to **registration completion** page upon successful validation of his credentials

User enters the invalid credentials and fails the validation test
